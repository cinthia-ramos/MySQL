To start this repository, I’m following the step-by-step instructions from the Data Analyst Bootcamp course (https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst). The course uses a database inspired by the series Parks and Recreation, which consists of three tables: employee_demographics, employee_salary, and employee_addresses.

Over time, I’ll add more detailed comments to the exercises to reinforce my understanding and make the content clearer for anyone exploring the files. Fun fact: I still need to watch this series!
